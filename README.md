# To Rule Them All Data Science Flowchart (TRTADSF)
The purpose of this project is to act as a resource to data scientists to help them be more efficient and effective at their jobs.
The purpose is NOT to act as a substitute for or replacement of underlying knowledge of coding and statistical concepts.

Key features:
* Flowchart of each data science concept
* Dynamic links to additional information
* Code snippets for quickly writing code

Have you ever thought through all the steps required for <insert data science concept here> and wondered what R/Python code would be required to complete each of those steps? Look no further- this project to help you (help yourself) through these steps. This resource consists of an RBookdown document with a flowchart for each topic and associated code for each step.
